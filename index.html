                              Turing was born in Maida Vale, London, while his father, Julius Mathison Turing, was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service.

                            Turing began edicaution at Hazelhurst Preparatory School.

                            At the age of 13, Turing went onto Sherborne School, The first day of term concieded with the 1926 General Strike, Turing was so determined to attend, that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles.

                            Turing encountered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank">Albert Einstien's</a> work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstien's questioning of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion" target="_blank">Newton's Law of Motion</a>.

                            At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with Christopher Collan Mocrom, who was described as Turing's "first love".

                            Turing published his paper on "Computable Numbers". It was published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Soicety Journal in two parts.

                            Turing worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School, the British codebreaking organisation.

                            Turing worked with Gordon Welchman to develop the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by Germans using their Enigma machines.

                            Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 co-worker Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly “unfazed” by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.

                            Turing invented the U decomposition method, used today for solving matrix equations.

                            Turing also wrote 'Inelligent Machinery', the first manifesto of Artifical Intelligence.

                              Turing started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing's house was burgled, the crime was reported and during the investigation, acknowledgement of his sexual relationship with Murray came to light; Both men were conviected of 'gross indeccency'.

                              Turing's housekeeper found him dead at the age of 41. Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death.
